## Folder Structure

- `Standalone` - This folder contains all the standalone projects that have been created during class. Each project is a self-contained C# project with the purpose of teaching a specific concept.
- `Unity` - This folder contains all the Unity projects that have been created during class. Each project is it's own Unity project/game.

## Standalone Projects

Inside the [Standalone](./Standalone/) contains a solution file which in this instance is called [Codekids.sln](./Standalone/CodeKids.sln), this solution file just lets us organise our projects into a single file. Inside the solution file, you will find a project for each standalone project that has been created during class.

## Unity Projects

Inside the [Unity](./Unity/) folder contains a folder for each Unity project that has been created during class. You can view the [README](./Unity/README.md) file inside the Unity folder for more information on each project.
